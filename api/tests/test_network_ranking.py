"""The network ranking adapter (stream B) on a tiny artificial protein network.

The bundle is built with stream B's own `build_artifacts`, from a made-up STRING links
file and mapping, the same way `python -m oxhack_api.prepare` builds the real one:

    G1 - G2 - G3 - G4 - G5 - G6 - G7 - G8     (the largest component)
              |
              G9 - G10
    G11 - G12                                  (a separate component)
    G13                                        (mapped, no links)

Disease Targets: G1, G5, G8, G11 (outside the largest component) and G14 (not mapped).
