"""The one place the API calls stream B: Zaid's `ranking/` at the repository root.

Stream B is untyped Python over JSON-shaped dicts, like stream A. This module gives
each call the API makes a typed signature, so strict type checking holds everywhere
else, and it is the only file that relaxes it for stream B. It adds no rule of its
own: the graph build, the network-proximity scoring, the shortlist policy and the
shortest-path reconstruction are all stream B's.

Stream B documents its inputs and outputs in `ranking/README.md` (the artefact
bundle), `ranking/STAGE2.md` (ranking) and `ranking/NETWORK_PATHS.md` (paths).
