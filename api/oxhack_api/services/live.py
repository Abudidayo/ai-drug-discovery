"""The live source (`OXHACK_SOURCE=live`): stream A's pipeline over the prepared data.

Prepare the data first with `uv run python -m oxhack_api.prepare`. A build runs
on the job's thread, in the stages the job runner reports:

- **targets**: stream A's A1 (`pipeline.disease_targets`): every Open Targets
  26.09 association of the Disease, rescored without clinical-precedence and
  cancer-biomarker evidence; the top 50 are the Disease Targets. The network
  ranking keeps those in its protein network (`retained`); with no network
  ranking every Target is kept.
- **ranking**: the `RankingBackend` (stream B's network ranking when its bundle
  is prepared, else the evidence ranking) ranks the approved drug universe
  (`drug_targets.json`, stream A's A2) into a shortlist of at most 15. A
  shortlisted drug that ChEMBL does not list as its own parent, or whose
  regulator-backed approval Open Targets cannot confirm, is left out and the next
  one takes its place; this is stream A's rule from `pipeline.experiment`.
- **evidence**: stream A's A4 (`build_evidence_packet`): each Candidate's
  sourced evidence, warnings and PubChem ID, the Reactome pathways its Targets
  share with the Disease Targets, and, with the network ranking, its
  representative routes in the protein network (`add_network_paths`). Every
  item's plain `summary` is built with `plain.py` from structured records (the
  association score, the ChEMBL mechanism record, the bioactivity pair, the
  approval report, the warning's toxicity class, the route's proteins, the
  pathway's members), never by reading the `statement` text.

Each build also writes its audit trail to `<data_dir>/experiments/<id>/`: the
Disease Targets, the ranking (with stream B's complete output, gzipped, and its
SHA-256), the jury evidence packet, mapping coverage and stream A's bioactivity
cross-check.

**Known answer.** A Candidate is the Experiment's known-answer check when stream
A's drug universe records a regulator-backed approval of it for this exact
Disease: an Open Targets 26.09 APPROVAL indication with an FDA, EMA, PMDA or
DailyMed report, or one of stream A's curated regulator records
(`pipeline/approval_overrides.json`, e.g. baricitinib for COVID-19). Stage data
lags regulators, so some real approvals are missing. The flag is computed after
ranking and never feeds it, but it is not a blind test: the evidence-only
association scores still include literature and other evidence that may reflect
the known use, so finding a known answer checks the pipeline, not a discovery
(plan.md section 6.3).
