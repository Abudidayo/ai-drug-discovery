"""The storage seam, implemented by `MemoryRepo` and `PostgresRepo`.

Each method maps onto the tables in `db/migrations/`:

- `add_experiment`, `set_build_state`, `set_archived_at`: `experiments`.
- `save_build_result`: `experiment_targets`, `candidates` and `experiments.network`.
- `add_jury_run`, `update_jury_run`: `jury_runs`, `jurors` and `jury_votes`.
- `add_dock_job`, `update_dock_job`, `find_reusable_dock_job`: `dock_jobs`.

The service checks rules (archived, already asked, job still running) and then
writes. `locked()` makes that check-then-write atomic: the memory repo holds a
lock; the Postgres repo opens a transaction and locks the Experiment row with
`SELECT ... FOR UPDATE`, and its triggers refuse the same changes again.

Background jobs are queued by the `Runner` (see `jobs.py`), not here.
